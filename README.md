# Hextris  

## Project Description

Hextris is a modern, web-based puzzle game inspired by Tetris but played on a hexagonal grid. Instead of dropping blocks into a rectangular playing field, players rotate a hexagon to catch falling colored blocks and create matches to score points. The game combines the classic appeal of falling-block puzzles with innovative hexagonal mechanics and enhanced match-3 gameplay.
